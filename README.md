Beware explosions from Bombs and Crates!
Bombs are easier to destroy than crates.
Crates can take a lot of damage before exploding and move quicker,
but it is more rewarding to destroy a crate.

The egg monster is indestructible, but can only attack if you're directly above it.
Walk through the egg monsters to avoid damage.

Pick up coins for points and med packs for health,
but beware the black poison pack!
